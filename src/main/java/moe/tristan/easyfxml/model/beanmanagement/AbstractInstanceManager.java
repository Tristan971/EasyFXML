/**
 * This class is aimed at helping you store references to various kinds of class instances.
 * <p>
 * We distinguish two types of instances :
 * - Single = only 1 instance of it is ever active at the same time)
 * - Multiple/Prototype = any number of instances active at the same time
 * <p>
 * In case all is well, you only use Single and getting the instance is as easy as providing the instance
 * that it is a children of.
 * <p>
 * In case you have stages multiple instances for the same parent instance, we cannot keep doing that.
 * This is why we need to make sure we can store them in an easy wa that can allow distinction
 * between those when needed afterwards.
 * See {@link #registerMultiple(TYPE_COMMON_INST, TYPE_SELECTOR, TYPE_ACTUAL_INST)} for this.

     * instance (but you won't be able to access it easily later), or some kind of related Node.
     * Whatever fits your model in the best way.
     * <p>
     * Be wary of collisions (i.e. Instance 1 and 2 having the same selector) as it replaces instances in case of collision.
     * <p>
     * You are responsible for providing correct and non-colliding selectors.
     * We also offer a sloght variation in the method with
     * {@link #registerMultiple(TYPE_COMMON_INST, Supplier, TYPE_COMMON_INST)}. Look at it if you think about writing
     * something like a {@link Function} &lt; {@link TYPE_COMMON_INST} , {@link Object} &gt; to compute selectors.
     *
     * @param commonInst An instance, typically an enum member
     * @param selector   The selector that you have to provide to recover this particular instance later
     * @param instance   The instance to save.
     * @return A map entry containing the selector and the controller registered in case you need it.
     * @throws RuntimeException in case there was an error in saving the instance.
